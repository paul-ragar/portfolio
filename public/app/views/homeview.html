      <h2>This is why I code.</h2>
      <p>All growing up I was surrounded with creativity. My dad, and his dad were both in the creative ad industry. I aspired to be just like them. Later on I found myself in college pursuing a degree in accounting. I figured it would be a safe choice considering that all businesses need accountants, and I would always be employed. During my schooling I enrolled in an advanced accounting class that explored Excel Visual Basic for Applications. It was the first sip of code that I had ever tasted, and I was hooked. I began teaching myself with every free tutorial I could find online. I then shifted my education towards web developing and have been creating ever since. Now I am proud to say that I can build full stack applications using multiple languages, and I'm eager to learn more as technology rapidly grows.</p>
      <h3>Here's what I use to create.</h3>
